# Script: Simulate phenotypic line breeding program with moderate GEI
# 
# Script authors: J. Bancic and  D.J. Tolhurst

#
# Description:
# This script simulates a line breeding program using phenotypic selection. 
# It tracks the breeding progress over years by summarizing measures like 
# genetic mean and variance (both observed in MET and expected in TPE), 
# accuracy (observed and expected), and MET-TPE alignment. The simulation 
# leverages FieldSimR and AlphaSimR packages to model GEI using a reduced 
# rank multiplicative model.
#
# The simulation involves six steps:
# 1. Import global parameters and a between-environment genetic variance
#     matrix that constitutes the TPE
# 2. Simulate founder parents with AlphaSimR and their genotype slopes with 
#     FieldSimR's wrapper function multi_asr_input()
# 3. Sample a subset of environments for each year's MET from the full TPE 
# 4. Fill the breeding pipeline with unique genotypes using AlphaSimR
# 5. Perform yearly selections across breeding stages based on phenotypic 
#     values simulated with FieldSimR's wrapper functions multi_asr_output() 
#     for simulating genetic values, field_trial_error() for simulating plot 
#     errors with spatial variation and make_phenotypes() to combine genotype
#     values and errors
# 6. Plot measures of genetic mean and variance (both observed in MET and 
#     expected in TPE), accuracy of phenotypic selection (both observed 
#     in MET and expected in TPE), and MET-TPE alignment
