##########################################################

# This script demonstrates how to simulate a reduced rank between-environment 
# genetic variance matrix, Ge, that captures GEI. The genetic variance matrix 
# will be summarised using measures of variance explained, and will form the
# basis of a reduced rank multiplicative model in the next script.
# The simulation is demonstrated with FieldSimR functions.

# The simulation involves four steps:
# 1. Simulating a diagonal genetic variance matrix using rand_diag_mat()
# 2. Simulating a between-environment genetic correlation matrix using struc_cor_mat()
# 3. Constructing the between-environment genetic variance matrix by combining the 
#    matrices in Steps 1. and 2.
# 4. Obtaining measures of variance explained using measure_interactions()

# It is also demonstrated how to simulate the between-environment genetic covariance matrix
# with specific structure, including genotype by year and genotype location interaction,
# as well as multiple TPE and multiple phenotypic traits

# Install FieldSimR from github using devtools
# devtools::install_github("crWerner/fieldsimr")

# Load FieldSimR
library(FieldSimR)

# Simulation parameters
p <- 1000      # number of environments in the TPE
# Genetic variance parameters
alpha <- 1.5   # shape of the gamma distribution
beta  <- 1     # scale of the gamma distribution 
# Genetic correlation parameters
rho <- 0.2     # baseline genetic correlation between environments in the TPE
k <- 7         # rank of the between-environment genetic correlation matrix
gamma <- -0.5  # skewness of the genetic correlation distribution


# The simulation
# 1. Simulate a diagonal genetic variance matrix, De, for all environments in the TPE 
# using FieldSimR's function rand_diag_mat().
De <- skew_diag_mat(n = p,
                    shape = alpha,
                    scale = beta)
# Plot the genetic variances using FieldSimR's function plot_hist()
plot_hist(df = diag(De))
mean(diag(De)) # mean genetic variance within environments


# 2. Simulate a between-environment genetic correlation matrix, Ce, for all environments 
# in the TPE using FieldSimR's function struc_cor_mat().
Ce <- struc_cor_mat(n = p,
                    base.cor = rho,
                    rank = k,
                    skew = gamma)
# Plot the correlation matrix using FieldSimR's functions plot_hist() and plot_matrix()
plot_hist(df = Ce[upper.tri(Ce)])
mean(Ce[upper.tri(Ce)])
plot_matrix(Ce,
            order = TRUE,
            labels = FALSE)


# 3. Construct the between-environment genetic variance matrix, Ge.
Ge <- sqrt(De) %*% Ce %*% sqrt(De)
# Plot the variance matrix using FieldSimR's functions plot_hist() and plot_matrix()
plot_hist(df = Ge[upper.tri(Ge)])
mean(Ge[upper.tri(Ge)]) # mean genetic correlation between environments


# 4. Obtain measures of variance explained to tune the matrices in Steps 1 and 2 using 
# FieldSimR's function measure_interactions().
measure_variances(mat = Ge)
# The mean genetic variance is partitioned into main effect and interaction variance.
# The interaction variance is further partitioned into heterogeneity of genetic variance 
# and lack of correlation. 
# Also presented are new measures which partition the mean genetic variance into
# non-crossover and crossover variance, with the former representing the variation 
# in each environment attributed to perfect positive correlation with the genotype 
# main effects.


# The below is not strictly required to run Supplementary Script S2.
# It is also possible to simulate Ce with various structure, including 
# (a) genotype by year with decaying correlations over time  
# (b) genotype by year and genotype by location interaction
# (c) multiple groups representing multiple TPE or traits

# (a) Simulate Ce to capture genotype by year interaction with decaying correlations over 
# time based on an autoregressive process of order one for the base function
pm <- 20       # number of environments
rho_ar1 <- 0.7 # baseline genetic correlation
ar1_base <- rho_ar1^abs(outer(X = 1:pm, Y = 1:pm, FUN = "-")) # base function
# Plot the base correlation matrix using FieldSimR's function plot_matrix()
plot_matrix(ar1_base)
# Add structured noise to the base correlation matrix using FieldSimR's function struc_cor_mat()
epsilon <- (1-rho_ar1)/(1+rho_ar1) # magnitude of noise, ensures Ce is positive (semi)-definite
Ce_a <- struc_cor_mat(base.mat = ar1_base,
                      range = epsilon,
                      rank = 3, 
                      skew = 0)
# Plot Ce using FieldSimR's functions plot_hist and plot_matrix()
plot_hist(df = Ce_a[upper.tri(Ce_a)])
mean(Ce_a[upper.tri(Ce_a)])
plot_matrix(Ce_a)
# The above is analogous to simulating Ce to capture genotype by location interaction with 
# decaying correlations over space

plot_hist(df = Ce_b[upper.tri(Ce_b)])
mean(Ce_b[upper.tri(Ce_b)])
plot_matrix(Ce_b,
            group.df = rep(1:ym, each = lm), 
            order = TRUE)
